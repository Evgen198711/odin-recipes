    <h3>Steps</h3>
        
            <ol>
                <li><h5>Starting with a cold pan, cook the garlic in olive oil:</li></h5>
                In a large, deep skillet or saucepan, combine the oil and garlic. Set the pan over medium heat, and heat until the garlic sizzles. Once it sizzles, cook for 15 to 20 seconds, or until the garlic turns a light golden brown. Do not let the garlic brown too much or the sauce will taste burned.
                <li><h5>Simmer the sauce:</li></h5>
                Add the tomatoes and salt to the pan. Bring to a gentle boil over medium heat and adjust the heat to a simmer. Continue to cook uncovered for 10-15 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened to your liking. 
                It may take a few minutes longer if the tomatoes from the can are watery. Taste and add more salt if needed. If the sauce seems acidic, add a pinch of sugar. Set sauce aside.
                <li><h5>Preheat the oven:</li></h5>
                Preheat the oven 375°F and bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for the pasta.
                Have on hand a 9 x 13-inch or equivalent baking dish.
                <li><h5>Make the filling:</li></h5>
                In a medium bowl, stir the ricotta, 1/2 cup of the mozzarella, 1/2 cup of the Parmesan, egg, lemon zest, parsley, salt, and pepper together until blended.
                <li><h5>Cook the pasta:</li></h5>
                Add the shells to the boiling water and cook for 2 minutes fewer than the package directions. 
                Reserve 1/2 cup pasta cooking water and drain the shells in a colander. Rinse under cool running water.
                <li><h5>Thin the tomato sauce, if needed:</li></h5>
                If the tomato sauce is thick, stir 1/4 to 1/2 cup of pasta cooking water into the sauce. It should not be runny but should spread easily when spooned into the baking dish. It will reduce and thicken somewhat in the oven.
                <li><h5>Fill and assemble the shells:</li></h5>
                Spread about 3/4 cup sauce on the bottom of the baking dish.
                Fill each shell with about 1-2 tablespoons of the ricotta mixture. Set them in the baking dish as you fill them, until all the filling is used. Spread the remaining sauce on top and sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan.
                <li><h5>Bake the shells:</li></h5>
                Cover the baking dish loosely with foil and bake for 25-30 minutes. Remove the foil, return the baking dish to the oven, and continue to bake for about 15 minutes, or until the cheese melts and the sauce bubbles. Let rest for 5 minutes, sprinkle with basil or parsley, and serve.
                <li><h5>Storage and reheating:</li></h5>
                Let casserole cool to room temperature. Cover with foil and refrigerate for up to 3 days. Reheat in a 350ºF oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until hot all the way through.
